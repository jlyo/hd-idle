  * Use %u in dprintf() when reporting number of reads and writes (the
    corresponding variable is an unsigned int).
  * Fix example in README where the parameter "-a" was written as "-n".

hd-idle (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * In case the SCSI stop unit command fails with "check condition", print a
    hex dump of the sense buffer to stderr. This is supposed to help
    debugging.

hd-idle (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * The parameter "-a" now also supports symlinks for disk names. Thus, disks
    can be specified using something like /dev/disk/by-uuid/... Use "-d" to
    verify that the resulting disk name is what you want.
  
    Please note that disk names are resolved to device nodes at startup. Also,
    since many entries in /dev/disk/by-xxx are actually partitions, partition
    numbers are automatically removed from the resulting device node.

  * Not really a bug, but the disk name comparison used strstr which is a bit
    useless because only disks starting with "sd" and a single letter after
    that are currently considered. Replaced the comparison with strcmp()

hd-idle (1.00) unstable; urgency=low

  * New parameter "-a" to allow selecting idle timeouts for individual disks;
    compatibility to previous releases is maintained by having an implicit
    default which matches all SCSI disks

  * Changed comparison operator for idle periods from '>' to '>=' to prevent
    adding one polling interval to idle time

  * Changed sleep time before calling sync after updating the log file to 1s
    (from 3s) to accumulate fewer dirty blocks before synching. It's still
    a compromize but the log file is for debugging purposes, anyway. A test
    with fsync() was unsuccessful because the next bdflush-initiated sync
    still caused spin-ups.
